PPspliT is a PowerPoint add-in that transforms each slide of a presentation into
a sequence of slides, each displaying the contents of the original slide as they
would appear at every intermediate animation step. As such, its most natural
context of application is to produce a redistributable version of a presentation
in a _flat_ file format like PDF.

To some extent, PowerPoint already provides export functions that are meant to
include animations in the target file (e.g., it can export a presentation as a
video). However, to my knowledge, a true conversion of existing slides into an
equivalent sequence of static (i.e., animation-less) slides that is suitable for
printing or PDF export has never been natively offered by PowerPoint. PPspliT
tries to fill this gap.

## Features
* **User experience**
  * Fully integrated with PowerPoint: it is natively implemented in Visual Basic
  for Applications (VBA).
  * Adds a new tab in PowerPoint's native ribbon toolbar (or dedicated toolbar
  for PowerPoint releases prior to 2007): splitting slides is a one-click task.
  * Can operate on a range of selected slides or on the whole presentation, if no
  slides are selected.
* **Capabilities**
  * Supports all entry, emphasis, exit and motion path effects applied to slide
  shapes (with some caveats, see below).
  * Supports "Rewind when done playing", "Hide on next mouse click" and
  "Auto-reverse" effect flags, as well as reversed motion paths.
  * Can split slides at every click-triggered animation effect (like it would
  happen during a slideshow) or at each and every animation effect (useful to
  preserve multiple intermediate animations that are played without any speaker
  interaction).
  * Can optionally preserve slide numbers during splitting: if slide footers
  contain text frames with dynamically computed slide numbers, these can be
  overwritten so that numbers in all the slides resulting from splitting a single
  original slide match its original slide number.
  * Operates with native PowerPoint shapes: the slides produced after the split
  are derived from the original presentation and still contain editable shapes.
  * Format-agnostic: since the final product is still a slide deck, you can
  export it to any document format for which you have a virtual printer or file
  converter installed. PDF is implicitly supported, as PowerPoint has been
  including an export function to this format for a few years now.

Some examples displaying the operation of the add-in can be found in the
[project home page][Home page].


## Usage
Simply click on the "Split animations" button of the PPspliT toolbar.
Using the appropriate checkboxes on the same toolbar, you can choose to split
slides on animation effects that are triggered by a mouse click (most common
usage) or just every animation effect (this may be especially slow). You can
also choose to preserve slide numbers during the split.

[Usage instructions](PPspliT-howto.pdf) are also available.

*Notice*: in all releases older than 2.0 the add-in makes heavy use of the
system clipboard. Therefore, it is very important that you refrain from using it
during the split and that no programs interfere with the clipboard at all.
Effective since release 2.0, this requirement has been relaxed, and the system
clipboard can be safely used while a slide deck is being split.

**Warning**: running the add-in will modify your presentation. Even though it is
generally possible to revert the changes using the undo feature (Ctrl+Z), it is
strongly advised to work on a copy of the original slide deck to avoid losing
your work by accidentally overwriting it with the split presentation.

It may take a while for the split process to complete. If you are wondering
1. why so much code and
2. why does it take so long to split animations

here are some hints:
* PowerPoint applies slideshow effects to rasterized versions of the shapes.
Instead, in PPspliT the same effects are re-implemented on the original shape
objects.
* VBA has some sparse bugs here and there, which allow limited or no access to
shape properties. I needed to work these around to my best.
* Each animation step requires creating a new slide, which is time consuming.
* For each animation step, all the shapes that are supposed to appear later on
by means of a subsequent entry effect or to have disappeared because of a
preceding exit effect must be appropriately removed.

## Building
As PPspliT is implemented as a VBA macro inside PowerPoint, there is no true
_build_ procedure. The source code is embedded in PowerPoint binary files that
are saved as native PowerPoint add-ins: this is also the reason why changes are
tracked in a separate file ([PPspliT-source.txt](PPspliT-source.txt)). \
The only step that requires _building_ is the generation of distributable
installers.

### Prerequisites
* Windows
  * [Nullsoft Scriptable Install System (NSIS)](https://sourceforge.net/projects/nsis/)
  * [Office 2007 Custom UI editor](http://openxmldeveloper.org/blog/b/openxmldeveloper/archive/2009/08/07/7293.aspx) -- As of June 2020, the link seems broken: you may try  using the [Office RibbonX Editor](https://github.com/fernandreu/office-ribbonx-editor) instead.
* MacOS
  * Script Editor (ships natively with MacOS)

### Packaging for Windows
* Edit the VBA macro inside `PPT12+\PPspliT.pptm` as needed, then prepare the
file as follows:
  * Update the release number if required (also in the about dialog box).
  * Save the file (`PPspliT.pptm`).
  * Export each module from the Visual Basic for Applications editor into
  corresponding `.bas`, `.frm` and `.frx` files.
  * Export the whole file as a PowerPoint add-in (`PPspliT.ppam`).
  * Open `PPspliT.pptm` using the Office 2007 Custom UI Editor or the Office
  RibbonX Editor, update the release number if required, and save the file.
  * Do the same for `PPspliT.ppam`.
* Apply consistent changes to file `PPT11-\PPspliT.ppt`, save it, export each
module and export the whole PPT file as a PowerPoint 97-2003 add-in (`PPspliT.ppa`).
* Edit file `ppsplit_installer.nsi` to refresh the release number if required.
* Process file `ppsplit_installer.nsi` through NSIS (usually it is enough to
right-click on the file and select "Compile NSIS script"). File `PPspliT-setup.exe`
should then be generated in the parent folder.

### Packaging for MacOS
* Apply changes to `PPspliT.pptm` and export it as PowerPoint add-inÂ `PPspliT.ppam`
as described above for the Windows case.
* Open file `MacOS/PPspliT for MacOS/Install PPspliT.app` using Apple's Script
Editor.
* Refresh resource `PPspliT.ppam` inside the script by dragging and dropping the
updated `PPspliT.ppam` inside the Script Editor.
* Save the installer and close the Script Editor.
* Open a Terminal window and run script `MacOS/PPspliT for MacOS/build_macos_dmg.sh`
to generate file `PPspliT.dmg`.

## Known limitations
Yes, the list is apparently long, but please look carefully through it because
it consists mostly of corner cases.
* PPspliT does not offer any PDF conversion functions: it is not meant to. It
just processes a presentation to split animations, then it is up to your
favorite PDF generation software or PowerPoint's native PDF export function to
generate the final PDF (or whatever other document format).
* PPspliT does not preserve animation effects: the slide deck resulting from a
split accurately renders the status of the slideshow at each intermediate
animation step, but every slide is cleared of all animation effects. This means
that you cannot have "moving shapes" in your final _flat_ (PDF) document. Even
if animations were preserved in the slides, embedding them in the final document
would require advanced processing functions for every possible output document
format, which is out of the scope of PPspliT, and would lead to much less
portable documents.
* All of the add-in features are implemented for all PowerPoint versions, but
minor glitches may exist with versions prior to 2007, sometimes due to VBA
limits or bugs.
* Some functions are knowingly unsupported and may never be implemented:
1. Slide transitions, as they are meant to smoothen slide changes and have no
persistent effects on their contents.
2. Shape dimming after playing an effect.
3. Effects and actions triggered by mouse clicks on a specific shape, including
cross-slide hyperlinks.
4. The shaking and blinking emphasis effects, due to a PowerPoint bug.
5. Processing of effects applied to individual shapes of SmartArt objects or
other composite objects (e.g., charts) because, to my knowledge, the interface
exposed by VBA to alter the properties of such shapes is somewhat limited. For
example, a position property like
`Selection.ShapeRange(1).SmartArt.Nodes(1).Shapes(1).Left` is read-only, and
methods like `ScaleHeight` or `Cut` affect the whole SmartArt object despite
being applied to its individual shapes.
6. Duration for emphasis effects (e.g., until next click or until the end of
the slide): considering that this property applies to iterations of an emphasis
effect, which is a dynamic property that PPspliT cannot and is not meant to
retain, all emphasis effects are simply assumed to last until the end of the
slide (or occurrence of a subsequent effect applied to the same shape).
7. Accurate rendering of color effects: they do not perfectly match
PowerPoint's behavior (which is not obvious to reverse engineer) but still
provide an acceptable emphasis effect.
8. Most emphasis and motion effects that apply to a single text paragraph
instead of a whole shape. In general, all those effects whose rendering
requires separation of the text frame from its parent shape are unlikely to be
supported.
9. Rasterized shape scaling. Indeed, PowerPoint applies effects to rasterized
versions of the shapes, thus proportionally scaling all their elements (e.g.,
shape borders). Instead, PPspliT resizes the native shape, thus preserving its
components (e.g., border thickness). The result is better because there is no
_pixelize_ effect, but it may be a little different from expected. This
difference is enhanced for the case of font scaling for grow/shrinking emphasis
effects: PPspliT renders this by changing font size by an amount that is a good
compromise between horizontal and vertical growth/shrink.
10. Accurate rendering of some rotation effects. During the presentation
PowerPoint rotates shapes around the center of the visible shape body. Instead,
PPspliT rotates it around the center of the container box. To explain the
difference, consider an arc, whose container box is the rectangle (or,
possibly, square) that encloses the full circle: at slideshow time PowerPoint
would rotate the arc around the center of the arc stroke itself, whereas
PPspliT would rotate it around the center of the container box, which is
usually larger, thus giving the impression that the visible shape (the arc)
has "wandered around".
11. Exit/entry effects applied to shapes that are part of a slide layout are only
partially supported. In fact, these shapes are turned into placeholders
(instead of disappearing altogether) when one attempts to delete them.
12. Adjustment of slide numbers on a PPTX file that is imported into PowerPoint
<=2003 using the Microsoft Office Compatibility Pack.
13. Adjustment of (dynamic) slide numbers that appear in standard text boxes
(i.e., only slide numbers appearing in special placeholder boxes that are
defined in slide masters and inserted as headers/footers in the slide deck are
recognized and supported).
14. Animations in slide masters.
15. Something else I am not aware of.

# Troubleshooting
* _The add-in is splitting only the first slide instead of the whole slide deck._ \
Maybe you have accidentally selected the first slide in the left-side thumbnail
pane of PowerPoint. Just try clicking anywhere in the main pane of
PowerPoint (i.e., the slide editor) and try PPspliTting again.
* _Error "Macro cannot be found or has been disabled because of security" is
displayed every time I try to split slides._ \
As an outdated but, possibly, still valid explanation, a [security update
released by Microsoft](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2598041/en-us") around
April 2012 may cause this issue with most VBA-based applications that make use
of dialog boxes, including PPspliT. To correct this problem, Microsoft suggests
deleting cached versions of control type libraries, which is harmless for your
system. I can confirm that this solution has worked for me. Basically, you have
to delete all `.exd` files stored in `%HOMEPATH%\Application
Data\Microsoft\Forms` and `%TEMP%\VBE`. Please rely on the official instructions
from Microsoft, which can be found in the page mentioned above. \
If this does not solve your problem, then either you are still using a really
outdated PPspliT release (1.5 was known to have such compatibility problems) or
your macro security settings may need to be reviewed.
